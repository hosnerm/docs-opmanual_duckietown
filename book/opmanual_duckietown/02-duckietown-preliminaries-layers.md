From a functional perspective, Duckietown cities are an integral part of the robotic ecosystem we call Duckietown. They are designed to send information to the Duckiebots, so these can operate.

Duckietowns are *modular*. They are composed of fundamental building blocks that can be combined to create nearly arbitrary city landscapes. Moreover, many hardware components are the same as those used for the Duckiebots.

At a high level, Duckietown is built with two layers, the *floor* and *signals* layers.

## Floor Layer {#dt-ops-floor-layer status=ready}

The floor layer is the substrate on which Duckiebots drive, i.e., the road.

Regardless of the geometry of the roads (straight, curve, intersections), roads are made of two lanes; one for each direction of driving. Lanes are obtained by applying lane markings a black background. The lane markings need to adhere to the [appearance specifications](#dt-ops-appearance-specifications) to be effective.

## Signals Layer {#dt-ops-signals-layer status=ready}

The signals layer contains all the [signs](#dt-ops-city-traffic-signs) and other functional objects (e.g., [traffic lights](#traffic-light-assembly)) that sit on top of the mats. Objects are functional when they enable some behavior for the Duckiebots. For example, traffic signs are functional because they inform Duckiebots at intersections where they are and what should they look out for to know when to drive on.

## Non-functional elements {#dt-ops-non-functional-layer status=ready}

The citizens of Duckietown like their cities to be colorful and fun, and encourage all efforts at adding non-functional components to the city. Non functional objects can still sit on the floor, e.g., decorative building, but make sure they don't interfere with the signals or floor layers!

Moreover, although Duckiebot drivers all have their driving licenses and know to focus on the road, the _background_, i.e., whatever is in the room the Duckietown was assembled, matters too. More information in this regards can be found in the [troubleshooting](#part:dt-ops-troubleshooting) section.

Note: the visual appearance of the area where the Duckietown is created is variable. If you discover that this appearance is causing negative performance, a "wall" of blank tiles constructed vertically can be used to reduce visual clutter.
